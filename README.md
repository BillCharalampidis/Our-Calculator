1.A simple Calculator Project, made in collaboration with Evaggelia Karampampa. It receives two Numbers from the user, then validates if they are indeed Numbers (otherwise informing the user to input only valid Numbers).
Then the calculation function operates, and prints the result.

2.Run the index.html file in any browser(making sure that both style.css and script.js are in the same folder as index.html).
